# Regression test: solve_martin() must produce the same projection
# as the canonical bimets pipeline from
# the bimets MARTIN port BIMETS_MARTIN_LOAD.R, given the bundled MARTINDATA
# fixture and no user adjustments.
#
# WHY THE ORIGINAL INLINE-REFERENCE TEST WAS WEAK
# -----------------------------------------------
# The first test below builds its "reference" by calling this package's OWN
# load_martin() and simulation_to_tibble(), then asserts solve_martin()
# matches it. That makes the comparison SELF-REFERENTIAL: it pins the glue
# (replay-AF construction, the SIMULATE call, the pivot) against itself but
# would NOT catch a regression in the shared ESTIMATE / residual pipeline —
# if load_martin() started fitting different coefficients, BOTH sides would
# move together and the test would still pass. It also only exercises the
# in-sample frozen, no-adjustment path (2010-2019Q3), never the forecast
# period the LLM actually operates in. We KEEP that bit-identity check (it is
# still the cleanest guard on the SIMULATE plumbing) but add two stronger
# tests below:
#   (1) pin specific ESTIMATEd coefficient values to expected numbers, so a
#       change in the estimate/residual pipeline is caught directly; and
#   (2) a forecast-period plausibility solve PAST the fixture data end, so the
#       out-of-sample path the round depends on is exercised.
#
# The reference is computed inline rather than loaded from a committed RDS:
# the bundled fixture is deterministic, so both pipelines should produce
# identical numbers in the same R session. The cost (one extra SIMULATE per
# test run) is modest and the alternative — committing a binary blob that
# can silently drift out of sync — is worse.

# Headline variables checked first. If these match, the bulk of the model
# is working; if not, the failure messages are immediately interpretable.
# N2R/N10R are included so the term-structure path is pinned by the
# bit-identity check (the EViews .prg random-walks these; the bimets file we
# solve uses the live expectations-hypothesis form -- see the dedicated
# form-pin test below).
