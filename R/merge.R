# Merge a live MARTIN database with a fallback (typically the bundled
# fixture). The live pipeline's behavioural equations need histories
# going back to the 1960s for some series — longer than live ABS / RBA
# data can reach. The fallback fills those gaps without overriding live
# data where it's at least as long.

#' Merge a primary MARTIN database with a fallback
#'
#' For each MARTIN variable, splice `primary` into `fallback`
#' quarter-by-quarter: take primary's value where primary has data,
#' fall back to fallback's value where primary is NA, and union the
#' time spans so the resulting series covers `min(primary_start,
#' fallback_start)` to `max(primary_end, fallback_end)`.
#'
#' This handles three real cases on Australian data:
#'
#'   (1) Live RBA series that start later than the fixture but extend
#'       past it — e.g. LUR live 1978-2026Q1 vs fixture LUR 1959-2019Q3.
#'       Older rule (primary wins only if it covers fallback's full
#'       range) discarded the 6+ years of recent LUR data; coalesce
#'       keeps fixture for 1959-1977 and live for 1978-2026Q1.
#'   (2) Live series that the agency stopped updating before the
#'       fixture's end — e.g. D02 credit ending 2019Q2 vs fixture's
#'       2019Q3. Coalesce takes live through 2019Q2 and fixture's
#'       2019Q3 value for the last quarter, then nothing past.
#'   (3) Live series whose values just don't reach back as far as
#'       MARTIN's behavioural-equation TSRANGEs need — coalesce fills
#'       the historical gap from fixture so estimation works.
#'
#' For LEVEL series with vintage drift (e.g. PTM, GDP), the splice
#' point can show a small step. This is bounded (typically <1-2 % of
#' the level) and economically harmless; for ratio / rate series
#' (LUR, NCR) the splice is seamless. Variables present only in
#' `primary` are added; variables present only in `fallback` are kept.
#'
#' Provenance is refined here, not guessed: when `primary` carries a
#' `"provenance"` attribute (as produced by [to_martin_database()]), the
#' merged database carries a refined one. A variable keeps its live class only
#' if the live path actually supplied a value; a variable that exists only in
#' `fallback`, or whose live series contributed no non-NA value to the union,
#' is recorded as `"fixture_fallback"`. When `primary` carries no provenance
#' attribute (e.g. a hand-built list in tests), the output is a plain list with
#' no provenance attached -- behaviour is otherwise unchanged.
#'
#' @param primary A named list of bimets TIMESERIES (typically a live
#'   sibyldata-produced database, carrying a `"provenance"` attribute).
#' @param fallback A named list of bimets TIMESERIES (typically
#'   `read_fixture()`).
#' @return A named list of bimets TIMESERIES with the spliced union
#'   per variable. When `primary` carries provenance, the result carries a
#'   refined `"provenance"` attribute (see [database_provenance()]).
