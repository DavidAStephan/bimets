# Extend a bimets residual time series forward via the EViews

# halves, then flips again and halves, etc. Returns the residual unchanged
# if it already extends to or past (end_year, end_quarter).

# Inputs:

#   end_year    integer
#   end_quarter integer 1..4
#   decay       numeric multiplier applied per quarter; default -0.5
#
# Returns: bimets time series extended to (end_year, end_quarter).
